## Language app with angularJS


We would like you to implement a very simple pacman  
The technology is AngularJS on front end, with NodeJS communication endpoint on backend, unit-testing with karma and protractor

### App


A Pacman game.


No need to use any database persistence on server-side - keeping data in NodeJS memory is sufficient at the moment.

### Running the app
    
    npm start / nodemon app.js / node app.js  (The 3 options are valid)

    then go to [http://localhost:3000] 


### Testing the app:   

    npm test                            (unit tests)
    protractor protractor-conf.js       (end to end tests)


### Functionality:




### Additonal tasks
